	"faqQuestion1" :" What is this website?",
	"faqAnswer1" :"This website has 3 different parts. One wallet explorer that indexes BTC blockchain by wallets or group of wallets belonging to an exchange, one ranking of crypto exchanges based on their on-chain activity and a crowdsourcing page that is an interface to an Autonomous Agent running on Obyte. We call counterstack protocol the mechanism that gives incentives to user providing accurate identification of BTC wallets used by crypto exchanges.",
	"faqQuestion2" : "How exchange statistics are made?",
	"faqAnswer2" : "Every hour, BTC blockchain is analyzed to evaluate transactions going from and to wallets that supposedly belong to them. The statistics are not completely accurate, since activity from addresses holding important amount or addresses newly generated can be missing. However, even if not perfect, that gives a good guess about their real activity.",
	"faqQuestion3" : "What is special with this explorer?",
	"faqAnswer3" : "Our explorer groups addresses that are known to belong to same wallet. All addresses that were ever present as inputs of a same transaction are merged into a wallet. Wallets can also be merged when some addresses that already belong to a wallet are seen as inputs of a same transaction, in this case the ID of the wallet that contains the more addresses is kept, while the other one is redirected. When a wallet is reputed to belong to an exchange, it is labelled as so, making life easy for those interested by flux going to or from exchanges.",
	"faqQuestion4" : "What does the crowdsourcing?",
	"faqAnswer4" : "We rely on gentle contributors to label wallets used by exchanges, they interact with an Autonomous Agent directly from their Obyte wallet after having clicked a link that prefills data to be sent. All information displayed are read from AA state variables.",
	"faqQuestion5" : "What is the counterstake protocol?",
	"faqAnswer5" : "It's a consensus mechanism that aims to feed Obyte DAG with accurate data from real world. First some rewards have to be donated by a sponsor, then an operation is initiated by a contributor. For this usecase, the operation is either adding a wallet to an exchange or removing the wallet to an exchange. This is expressed by a question that can be answered by YES or NO. The initiator sends {initial_stake} GB as stake and provides one or several URL proving that the answer is YES. If it is convincing enough, the operation period goes to its end and the initiator receives his initial stake and the reward. If proofs are not convincing, one can challenge the position and put bytes at stake on NO. If the amount on NO reaches {coeff}x the amount that is staked on yes, the outcome is reversed. Then the initiator would lose its stake, miss the reward while the challenger would receive all the stake. It's always possible to inverse again the outcome by putting more bytes at stake and reach {coeff}x the amount staked of the opposite. The challenge ends after {period} days without counterstaking. When several users staked on same position, gains are shared in prorata of their contribution.",
	"faqQuestion6" : "Is this opensource?",
	"faqAnswer6" : "Yes! Github-link. We expect that it will inspire other developers for creating exciting application based on counterstake protocol. If you want to contribute to this website and please come on Discord to discuss your plans with us."
